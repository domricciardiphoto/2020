You want your roof to hold up during rainy nights. You want your windows to open to bring in fresh air. In the heat of summer, you want to stay cool. For those without the luxury of central air conditioning, this desire requires new, portable solutions. Enter the portable air conditioning unit.</div><div class=promo100><h2>Why is a portable air conditioning unit right for me?</h2><br><p>If you rely on a window air conditioner to cool your home, only frequent a few spaces of your home, or simply do not have air conditioning in your current space, a portable air conditioner may be best for you.</div><div class=promo100><div class=promo100><h2>Why should I choose a portable unit over a window unit?</h2></div><div class=promo60><p>Modern portable units are made to have higher energy efficiency than window units and do not suffer from the wear and tear caused by being exposed to the sun all day. Window units also obstruct natural light and window views, and are banned entirely in some cities and neighborhoods.<h2>How do portable AC units work?</h2><p>Portable AC units facilitate airflow through a space, cooling hot spots and reducing humidity. Portable AC units typically use a standard window venting kit to expel exhaust, but can be vented through doors or wall holes if no windows are available. It’s not too different from a common dryer hose – you need a place for that hot air to go</div><div class=promo40><img src=/images/promos/FHPH132AB1_Drop_In_4.jpg title="Outdoor Speakers"></div></div><div class=promo100><p>Portable AC machines are available in single or dual hose units.<p>Single hose portable AC units typically use less energy, and therefore typically cost less than dual hose options. With a single hose unit, stagnant air is pulled from the room and the unit expels cool air for circulation through the space. Excess hot air and humidity is funneled through the hose and out of the vent space.<p>Dual hose portable AC units can bring cool air to a space more quickly and efficiently than single hose units. Units with dual hoses pull fresh air from outside through one hose, and expel excess warm air and humidity through the other hose.</div><div class=promo100><div class=promo100><h2>What features are included in a portable AC unit?</h2><p>Units are almost always equipped with wheels or casters for easy movement from room to room (hence the name portable). Other features vary by brand and style. Dependent on your needs, you can find a unit with any of the following:</div><div class=promo60><ul><li>A timer – ideal for spaces that may not be used constantly, saving you energy and money toward an electric bill<li>A remote control – for easy operation<li>Caster wheels – for maximum portability<li>Dry/Dehumidify feature- removes excess moisture without changing temperature<li>Oscillation- the unit can move from side to side, effectively covering a larger area<li>Varying fan speeds<li>Auto feature- made for those looking to "set it and forget it"<li>Wi-Fi connection - for optimal customization</ul><p>Not every model is equipped with the same bells and whistles as above. To find the best portable air conditioner for your space, think about your unique needs.</div><div class=promo40><img src=/images/promos/GHPC132AB1_Drop_In_2.jpg title=YETI></div></div><div class=promo100><h2>How do you determine space requirements for a portable AC unit?</h2><p>In order to understand your needs, it’s important to understand how energy requirements are measured. Cooling capacity for portable AC units are measured in BTUs, or British Thermal Units. A BTU is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 lb. of water by 1-degree Fahrenheit at sea level. The more BTUs are on a unit, the higher the cooling capacity for a space.<p>It's natural to think that the bigger BTU rating the better when it comes to maximum comfort. However, using a unit with too many or too few BTUs for a space will cause the machine to work improperly, and often bring a significant bump to your electric bill.<p>To properly determine your BTU requirements for a space, you need to know the square feet of the room, which can be found by multiplying the length of your room by its widt<p>Once you know the square footage of your space, multiply that by 40 BTU to calculate your initial BTU requirement. For final calculations, take the features of your home and lifestyle into account. Rooms with many windows and lots of sun exposure, multiple people in the home, and frequently used kitchens all call for a higher BTU.<h2>Still having trouble making your final calculations?

This is because portable units can generate waste heat indoors.<p>The noise level on these machines can be disruptive, as they are not the quietest machines – longer hoses and slower fan speeds may help with this potential issue.</div><div class=promo100><h2>How do you maintain a portable air conditioner?</h2><br><p><span style=text-decoration:underline>Preparation</span><p>The first step to good maintenance is good preparation.
