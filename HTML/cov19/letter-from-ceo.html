<div>
    To Our Valued Customers,
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    For 110 years, P.C. Richard &amp; Son has been committed to providing our
    communities with essential appliances, technology and a world class
    shopping experience. During these unprecedented times, we have continued
    this commitment to you, our customers, by meeting the increased demand for
    freezers, refrigerators, washers, dryers, computers and other home office
    essentials, necessary for keeping your home lives fully operational.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    In order to continue to provide you with these essential products, we are
    announcing a new way to shop with us in eligible stores, “contactless”
    Curbside Pick-Up. This service will allow you to pick-up the product you
    need without requiring you to enter our stores. These new measures will
    provide added safety for both our customers and employees. For any eligible
    items ordered on PCRichard.com, follow the instruction on your confirmation
    email, and we will deliver the product directly to your car while it is
    parked in our store’s parking lot.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    If you have not ordered online in advance and would like to take advantage
    of this service, we will be more than happy to assist you. When you arrive
    at the store, please stay in your car. You may then call the store phone
    number and place an order with a sales representative. Your merchandise
    will be brought to your trunk without you leaving your car. Please be
    advised, certain locations will remain closed and will not be offering
    “contactless” curbside pick-up. Please visit our website for an up-to-date
    list of eligible stores.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    In the interest of providing further safety to our customers and employees,
    we are also making changes to our Next Day Home Delivery service. Effective
    March 23rd, for the delivery of large appliances and TVs, we will deliver
    the product to your doorstep or to an open garage only. Unfortunately, we
    are unable to bring the product inside your home. We sincerely apologize
    for any inconvenience that this may cause. We will gladly take your old
    appliance for proper disposal, if it is outside of your home and has been
    cleaned.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    We are also suspending all product installations, and non-appliance service
    calls. Should you require assistance rescheduling a previously scheduled
    delivery, installation, or service call, please call <a href="tel:1-877-727-1909">1-877-727-1909</a>, and we
    will happy to assist you.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    We are continuously monitoring all communications from the Centers for
    Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization and
    implementing guidelines and best practices as they are issued. As the
    circumstances of this pandemic change, so too may our plans and operations.
    We are committed to continuously updating our loyal customers and valued
    employees as changes in circumstances occur.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    The Richard family thanks you for your ongoing loyalty and understanding
    during these challenging times. Rest assured, we are committed to
    continuing to provide you with essential appliances and technology
    equipment so you can remain both safe and connected.
</div>
<div>
    <br/>
</div>
<div>
    Be safe.
</div>
