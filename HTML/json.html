            "text": "A BTU, or British Thermal Unit, is the amount of energy needed to raise 1 pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit while at sea level. When it comes to <a href="/category/Heating-and-Cooling/Air-Conditioners/_/N-1xwcz9f\">air conditioners</a>, the BTU rating tells you how many BTUs per hour the machine can remove from the air. The higher the rating, the more high-intensity the cooling."

            "text": "Short answer no, but there has been some change in recent years in regards to their BTU Rating system. Why did the BTU rating for portable A/Cs need an upgrade? <a href="/category/Heating-and-Cooling/Air-Conditioners/Portable-Air-Conditioners/_/N-ui75ge">Portable air conditioners</a> were originally labeled with the same BTU rating system as window and through-the-wall air conditioners, and it wasn't until recently that manufacturers realized this led to an inaccurate assessment of the unit's cooling capabilities."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "In order to create a comfortable temperature, an air conditioner must be able to dehumidify the air as well as cool it. Using an air conditioner that's too big for the room will result in it shutting off early without allowing the space to properly dehumidify, and the excess moisture will create an uncomfortably damp environment."

            "@type": "Answer",
            "text": "If the air conditioner is too small for the room, it can't bring the room to a comfortable coolness level. The unit will be running constantly without hitting the proper temperature and dehumidification levels, making it extremely inefficient and costly."
