<p>A <a href="/category/Appliances-Housewares/Kitchen-Appliances/Refrigerators/_/N-1fdz1nb">refrigerator</a> is a serious purchase – after all, it’s not often you buy something you intend on using every single day for at least the next ten years. We understand that anyone who’s been out of the refrigerator-shopping game for a while may feel overwhelmed by modern icebox options, and we want to make sure you’re well-informed before taking the (refreshingly cool) plunge into refrigerator commitment. Here’s a breakdown of today’s most common refrigerator styles!</p>

<h2><img class="alignleft size-full" src="/images/content/types-of-refrigerators-top-mount.jpg" alt="Top Mount Refrigerator" width="200" height="200" />Top Freezer Refrigerator</h2>
<p>Tried and true, this is the classic refrigerator style that’s been a kitchen mainstay for decades. While the <a href="/category/LP/Top-Freezer-Refrigerators/_/N-15l4a2h">top freezer refrigerator</a> means having the refrigerator at a lower level , which may not be ideal for some customers (i.e. the taller ones), the low cost of these models may be an agreeable tradeoff. This style is hands-down the most affordable option, making it a great choice for buyers on a budget. It’s also available in a variety of sizes to fit into kitchens large and small.</p>

<h2><img class="alignright size-full" src="/images/content/types-of-refrigerators-side-by-side.jpg" alt="Side-by-Side Refrigerator" width="200" height="200" />Side-by-Side Refrigerator</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for a slim style, <a href="/category/LP/Side-by-Side-Refrigerators/_/N-z44t2o">side-by-side refrigerator</a> models feature a vertical freezer and refrigerator that sit directly next to each other. The slim profile does limit the sizes of the foods that can be stored, and these models aren’t as energy-efficient as other available refrigerator styles. However, it’s another incredibly budget-friendly choice. In addition to the attractive low cost, Side-by-Side refrigerators also have the benefit of requiring a small door swing space, making them ideal for kitchens with limited area. Most models also feature an external ice machine and water dispenser.</p>

<h2><img class="alignleft size-full" src="/images/content/types-of-refrigerators-bottom-mount.jpg" alt="Bottom Mount Refrigerator" width="200" height="200" />Bottom Freezer Refrigerator</h2>
<p>The <a href="/category/LP/Bottom-Freezer-Refrigerators/_/N-vtdvo8">bottom freezer refrigerator</a> is extremely popular with good reason. These models provide a large block of storage space for both the refrigerator and freezer sections, allowing easy accommodation of contents in a variety of sizes and widths. Many people also prefer the convenience of having the refrigerator section directly at eye level, making it easier to quickly find what they need.</p>

<h2><img class="alignright size-full" src="/images/content/types-of-refrigerators-french-door.jpg" alt="French Door Refrigerator" width="200" height="200" />French Door Refrigerator</h2>
<p><em>Très jolie</em> - the <a href="/category/LP/French-Door-Refrigerators/_/N-x5szui">French door refrigerator</a> brings a modern look into your kitchen. Not only does the lower-freezer setup mean large blocks of storage space, but the ability to open only one refrigerator door at a time minimizes the escape of cool air. Many models include a drawer-style freezer, but some include French doors on the freezer area as well. The French doors require a small swing space, and just like standard Bottom Freezer models, there’s lots of versatility in accommodating wide or large items.</p>

<a name="counter"></a>
<h2><img class="alignleft size-medium" src="/images/content/types-of-refrigerators-counter.png" alt="Counter-Depth Comparison" width="250" height="250" />Counter-Depth Refrigerator</h2>

<h2><img class="alignright size-medium" src="/images/content/types-of-refrigerators-mini.jpg" alt="Mini Fridge" width="200" height="200" />Mini Fridge</h2>
