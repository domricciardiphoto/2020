Some more practical people dream ofgadgets that make life easier, like vacuuming vents in the floors so you never have to bend down with a dustpan ever again. Some people dream of beauty, hoping to adorn their halls with HGTV’s hottest trends. Some people crave an area that’s entirely their own – and that’s how the man cave came to be.</p></div><div class="promo50"><img src="/images/promos/blogpromo-cave-d4.jpg" title="Man Cave Essentials &amp; Must Haves" /></div><div class="promo50"><p>No matter what your gender, you deserve a sanctuary: a place to play, reflect, and live entirely free of the constraints of pants. We’ve taken to basements, bonus rooms and backyard sheds to create our habitats. We fill each space with things that we love to create a zone that revolves solely around us. The room becomes a perfect extension of ourselves, and now more than ever, we could all use a nice in-home getaway. Everyone's tastes are unique, but we can agree that there are essentials that elevate any recreation-focused spot in your home.</p></div></div><div class="promo100"><div class="promo100"><h2>The Basics</h2><br></div><div class="promo50"><ul><li> <strong>TV/Home Theatre System – </strong>Whether you’re watching TV shows, movies, or your favorite cat videos, a great TV setup is the key to success.</li><li> <strong>Audio Equipment – </strong>My own dad dedicates most of his time in the man cave to music, usually by playing his guitars.

Think about what you enjoy doing and have little space or time to do, and bring those features to the forefront.</p></div><div class="promo50"> <img src="/images/promos/blogpromo-cave-d0.jpg" title="Man Cave Essentials &amp; Must Haves" /></div></div><div class="promo100"><div class="promo100"><h2>For the Entertainer</h2><br><p>We know large gatherings are unfortunately not in the cards these days, but one day they will be again!
