"Smart" Features </h2><br><p>Make sure your unit has the "smart" features that matter to you! Do you want to simply turn the unit on or off via your smartphone, or do you need voice command compatibility and connection to your smart home hub? What about temperature and fan speed control? Do you want to set a daily schedule?</p><p>Read up on the smart capabilities offered by each smart AC before you buy, as the features vary from product to product. Some products, such as the Friedrich Kuhl line, have all the bells and whistles for smart connectivity, plus the ability to group one or more units into one schedule. Always make sure the unit you are purchasing is as smart as you need. </p><h2>2. Sizing Options </h2><br><p>What is the size of the space are you looking to cool and condition? Make sure the model you are looking for has BTU (British Thermal Unit) options to fit that space. Use our <a title="BTU calculator" href="/library/blogArticle/btu-calculator-what-size-air-conditioner-do-i-need/3700030.pcra">BTU calculator</a> for a general idea of the air conditioner size you need, but conditions can vary based on sun exposure and other factors, so always check with an expert to confirm.</p><h2>3. Quality &amp; Durability </h2><br><p>Quality components lead to a better overall product, which impacts how well the product operates and its longevity. How long are you planning on keeping/using your AC? One summer? Five summers? 10+ summers? That's where quality and energy efficiency really count! You may be searching for "smart" system capabilities, but if the unit doesn't operate or cool well, isn't efficient, and doesn't last – well, that's not very smart. </p><h2>4. Noise Levels </h2><br><p>It's important to think about where your AC unit will be used. If it's in the living room, then you may not be as sensitive to noise, but if it is in your bedroom, next to you bed – then SOUND IS CRUCIAL! When investigating products, make sure that sound technology is a consideration and that the unit contains sound insulating, as well as vibration isolating materials for low and comfortable sound levels. </p><h2>5. Brand Reputation </h2><br><p>Finally, make sure you are purchasing a product from a manufacturer with a solid reputation. Do your research on how long the brand has been in business. Will they be there for the duration of your air conditioner's lifetime to support the product? Do they have a strong history of building quality products across the board? Are ACs the sole focus on the company, or just one segment? Brands such as Friedrich Air Conditioning have been in business since 1883, are dedicated solely to air conditioning technology and have a long-standing reputation for building a quality product that lasts.</p><p>Consider the above five factors when shopping for your new smart AC, and visit a <a title="P.C.
